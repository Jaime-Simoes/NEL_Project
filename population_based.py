class PopulationBased(RandomSearch):
    """Population-based ISA (PB-ISAs).

    Based on the number of candidate solutions they handle at each
    step, the optimization algorithms can be categorized into
    Single-Point (SP) and Population-Based (PB) approaches. The solve
    procedure in the SP algorithms is generally guided by the
    information provided by a single candidate solution from ùëÜ,
    usually the best-so-far solution, that is gradually evolved in a
    well defined manner in hope to find the global optimum. The HC is
    an example of a SP algorithm as the solve is performed by
    exploring the neighborhood of the current best solution.
    Contrarily, the solve procedure in PB algorithms is generally
    guided by the information shared by a set of candidate solutions
    and the exploitation of its collective behavior of different ways.
    In abstract terms, one can say that PB algorithms share, at least,
    the following two features: an object representing the set of
    simultaneously exploited candidate solutions (i.e., the
    population), and a procedure to "move" them across ùëÜ.

    An instance of a PB-ISA is characterized by the following features:
        1) a PI (i.e., what to solve/optimize);
        2) a function to initialize the solve at a given point of the
         solve space (ùëÜ);
        3) the best solution found by the PB-ISA;
        4) the number of simultaneously exploited solution (the
         population's size);
        6) a collection of candidate solutions - the population;
        7) a random state for random numbers generation;
        8) the processing device (CPU or GPU).
