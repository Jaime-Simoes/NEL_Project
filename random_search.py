    """Random Search (RS) Algorithm.

    Random Search (RS) can be seen as the very first and rudimentary
    stochastic iterative solve algorithm (SISA) for problem-solving.
    Its strategy, far away from being intelligent, consists of
    randomly sampling S for a given number of iterations. RS is
    frequently used in benchmarks as the baseline for assessing
    algorithms' performance. Following this rationale, one can
    conceptualize RS at the root of the hierarchy of intelligent
    SISAs; under this perspective, it is meaningful to assume that the
    SISAs donated with intelligence, like Hill Climbing and Genetic
    Algorithms, might be seen as improvements upon RS, thus branching
    from it.

    An instance of a RS can be characterized by the following features:
        1) a PI (i.e., what to solve/optimize);
        2) a function to initialize the solve at a given point of the
         solve space (ùëÜ);
        3) the best solution found by the ISA;
        4) a random state for random numbers generation;
        5) the processing device (CPU or GPU).

    To solve a PI, the RS:
        1) initializes the solve at a given point in ùëÜ (normally, by
         sampling candidate solution(s) at random);
        2) searches throughout ùëÜ, in iterative manner, for the best
         possible solution by randomly sampling candidate solutions
         from it. Traditionally, the termination condition for an ISA
         is the number of iterations, the default stopping criteria in
         this library.
